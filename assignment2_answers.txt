1. My router is remedial compared to Rails'. With Rails' routing, you can set which
HTTP verbs you want active for each controller, you can specify which controller
actions correspond to different HTTP verbs, you can drive what HTTP verb requests
are processed by mapping different actions to key presses and mouse clicks.

My router is just looking at the env Hash which contains some information about
what client sent the request and  what information is in the URL. My router only
works if the URL is of a nice pattern wherein it is given host/controller/action/otherstuff.

So we're missing the ability to control the app by any means other than what is
passed in to env["PATH_INFO"].
